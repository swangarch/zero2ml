## üìå Current Progress

- [x] Python for data science
- [x] Linear Regression (main algo with Rust)  
- [x] Logistic Regression
- [x] Neural Network
- [ ] More to come... üöÄ


## üìå Requirements

These projects are mainly built with Python, while a few use Rust. Therefore, some dependencies are required.  

Each project includes a `venv.sh` and `requirements.txt` to help you set up a virtual environment and install the necessary packages:  

```bash
bash venv.sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

Note: The projects were developed on linux (ubuntu).
If you are using WSL, some visualization scripts may not work properly due to the lack of GUI support.


## üìå Projects

### 0. Python for Data Science ‚úÖ

This module is part of the 42 curriculum (‚ÄúPython for Data Science‚Äù) and is designed to introduce Python in the context of data science.  
It covers the fundamentals of Python programming and gradually applies them to data processing and analysis tasks.  

Main topics include:  
- Python basics: syntax, data structures, control flow, and package management  
- Arrays and matrix operations, as well as image manipulation exercises using NumPy  
- Data processing and visualization (e.g., CSV handling, plotting) with Pandas and Matplotlib  
- Functional and object-oriented programming with modular design and inheritance
- Exploring statistics, and advanced Python features such as decorators and closures

This module builds the foundation for later machine learning projects.

### 1. Linear Regression ‚úÖ

The goal of this project is to predict car prices based on their mileage, as these two factors have a linear correlation.
As an introduction to machine learning, gradient descent is used to minimize the loss function (MSE) in order to find the 
appropriate values of Œ∏‚ÇÄ and Œ∏‚ÇÅ. These two parameters are updated simultaneously during the process, allowing the loss 
function to descend in the steepest direction.

Linear regression is implemented with three programs, main algorithm is implemented with Rust, visualizer with python:

#### üìñ Programs

1. **Predictor**  
   - Usage:  
     ```
     cargo run <weight.txt>
     ```  
   - Reads model parameters from `weight.txt`.  
   - If no `weight.txt` is available, it uses default weights `(0, 0)`.  
   - Outputs the predicted price for the given `km` value.  

2. **Trainer**  
   - Usage:  
     ```
     cargo run <data.csv>
     ```  
   - Takes a CSV file containing training data (`km`, `price`).  
   - Trains the linear regression model using gradient descent.  
   - Saves the final model parameters into `weight.txt`.  

3. **Visualizer**  
   - Usage:  
     ```
     python visualize.py <path_to_training_program> <path_to_data_csv>
     ```  
   - Runs the Rust training program, collects the results,  
     and visualizes the training process and regression line using Python (matplotlib).

### 2. Logistic Regression ‚úÖ

This project builds a generalized logistic regression classifier in python to predict a Hogwarts house based on student features.

Logistic regression is usually used for binary classification tasks, this project applies a one-vs-all strategy to handle the 
multi-class setting. The implementation is highly modular and encapsulated, so the same class can be reused for other datasets. 
Thus, it serves as a flexible solution for general multi-class linear classification problems.

This project also includes a data science part with analysis and visualization to better understand the dataset.

#### üìñ Programs  

0. **Describer**  
   - Usage:  
     ```bash
     python describe.py <data.csv>
     ```  
   - Describe the training dataset.  

1. **Visualizer**  
   - Usage:  
     ```bash
     python histogram.py <data.csv>
     python scatter_plot.py <data.csv>
     python pair_plot.py <data.csv>
     ```  
   - Plots the training dataset with histogram, and scatter plot.  
   - Displays intuitively the distribution of data.

2. **Trainer**  
   - Usage:  
     ```bash
     python logreg_train.py <dataset_train.csv>
     ```  
   - Takes a CSV dataset with labeled classes.  
   - Trains the logistic regression model using gradient descent.  
   - Saves the trained weights into `output/weights.txt`.  

3. **Predictor**  
   - Usage:  
     ```bash
     python logreg_predict.py <dataset_train.csv> <dataset_test.csv> <weights.txt>
     ```  
   - Loads trained weights from `weights.txt`.  
   - Predicts class probabilities for given test samples.  
   - Outputs predicted class csv.
   - One-vs-all tasks with multi models training.

### 3. Neural Network ‚úÖ

Neural Network is implemented as an encapsulated class in Python,  
capable of solving both regression and classification tasks.  
The design goal is to provide a reusable and modular implementation.

#### üìñ Programs  

1. **Train and Predict**  
   - Usage:  
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```  
   - Defines the network structure (layers, activation functions).  
   - Trains using backpropagation and gradient descent.  
   - Visualize loss and prediction.  


2. **Class example** 

#### üìò Example: Train and Test a Neural Network

Below is a simple example of using the `NN` class to train a regression model.

```python
from utils.activation_func import relu, sigmoid
from utils.data_generation import generate_data_1d
from utils.nnClass import NN


def main():
    try:
        # Define network structure: input ‚Üí 64 ‚Üí 32 ‚Üí output
        net_shape = (1, 64, 32, 1)
        activation_funcs = (relu, relu, None)  # last layer is linear (regression)

        # Initialize neural network
        nn = NN(net_shape, activation_funcs)

        # Generate training data
        inputs, truths = generate_data_1d(142, 100)
        nn.train(inputs, truths, max_iter=20000, learning_rate=0.05)

        # Test with new data
        test_inputs, test_truths = generate_data_1d(123, 80)
        nn.test(test_inputs, test_truths)

        # Show loss curve
        nn.show_loss()

    except Exception as e:
        print("Error:", e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
