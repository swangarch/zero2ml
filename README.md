# zero2ml-rust

**zero2ml-rust** is a **practice project** to learn machine learning **from zero**,  
by re-implementing fundamental algorithms in **Rust**, with **Python** for visualization.

The purpose of this repository is **educational**:  
to understand how classic ML models work internally,  
not to build a production-ready library.

---

## âœ¨ Highlights

- **From Zero** â†’ no external ML frameworks, everything implemented from scratch  
- **Rust** â†’ safe, fast, and memory-efficient for algorithm implementation  
- **Python** â†’ clear and simple visualization with matplotlib
- **Educational** â†’ designed as a step-by-step learning exercise

## ðŸ“Œ Current Progress

- [x] Linear Regression (done ðŸŽ‰)  
- [ ] Logistic Regression (WIP)  
- [ ] Multilayer Perceptron (planned)
- [ ] More to come... ðŸš€


### 1. Linear Regression âœ…

Linear regression is implemented with three programs:

#### ðŸ“– Programs

1. **Predictor**  
   - Usage:  
     ```
     cargo run <weight.txt>
     ```  
   - Reads model parameters from `weight.txt`.  
   - If no `weight.txt` is available, it uses default weights `(0, 0)`.  
   - Outputs the predicted price for the given `km` value.  

2. **Trainer**  
   - Usage:  
     ```
     cargo run <data.csv>
     ```  
   - Takes a CSV file containing training data (`km`, `price`).  
   - Trains the linear regression model using gradient descent.  
   - Saves the final model parameters into `weight.txt`.  

3. **Visualizer**  
   - Usage:  
     ```
     python visualize.py <path_to_training_program> <path_to_data_csv>
     ```  
   - Runs the Rust training program, collects the results,  
     and visualizes the training process and regression line using Python (matplotlib).

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

By the end of this project, the repository will contain:  
1. A minimal set of ML algorithms written in Rust  
2. Python scripts & notebooks for visualizing training results  
3. A clean and educational codebase that shows **how ML works under the hood**
